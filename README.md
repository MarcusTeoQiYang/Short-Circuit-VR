# Short-Circuit-VR
Interactive Programming for Virtual Reality project
This VR projects aims to target Students/ Teachers/ People who are interested in learning circuit analysis and digital fundamentals. Application is solely for educational purposes. The purpose of our application is to create a virtual lab to educate users on lab equipment usage and precautions. This app also provides hands-on experience on circuit patching, allowing users to have fun experimenting with components and creating real-time projects. Since our application is meant to educate users on circuitry, users will able to participate and experience hands on patching of circuits, this will save money and time for users as they are not required to purchase physical components. Using this application will also be safer for users as they are not prone to hazardous events that are commonly experience in physical labs.
